An error logging component using the Chain of Responsibility pattern. Supports multiple output channels like local files, remote APIs, and console logs‚Äîideal for flexible and scalable logging strategies.

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require hejunjie/error-log
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

use Hejunjie\ErrorLog\Logger;
use Hejunjie\ErrorLog\Handlers;

$log = new Logger([
    new Handlers\ConsoleHandler(),                // Print to console
    new Handlers\FileHandler('path'),  // Save to file
    new Handlers\RemoteApiHandler('url')       // Send to a specific address
]);

$log->info('title','content',['Context']);     // INFO Level
$log->warning('title','content',['Context']);  // WARNING Level
$log->error('title','content',['Context']);    // ERROR Level

$log->log('level','title','content',['Context']);
```

## Purpose & Original Intent

The origin of this component is actually quite simple:
The code runs on different servers, some are as quiet as retired old men, while others explode into fireworks at the slightest provocation ‚Äî but they're all running "the same code," and every time something breaks, they come looking for me.

The most absurd part is that everyone claims they‚Äôre running the "latest version," but whether it's a code issue, an environment issue, or a deployment issue, who knows?
So, I wrote this little tool: to flexibly output logs to files, consoles, and remote servers, with customizable formats. This way, I can find the problem before I'm questioned.

Later, I also wrote a small log receiving script. Combined with this component, it can directly display remote logs, allowing me to receive, display, filter, and manage log error information.
